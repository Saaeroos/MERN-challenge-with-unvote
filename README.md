# MERN-challenge-with-unvote

this project was build after doing the Restart Network MERN challenge.

I was curious about making the user vote once and then the user will be able to unvote,
so i worked on those features and mange to do them.


This project was build using:  React, mongodb and mlab.


This project was deployed using:   google cloud and firebase.
